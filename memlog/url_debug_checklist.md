# URL Debug Checklist

## Development Server
### Current Status
- [x] Local development server running on default port
- [x] Asset loading working correctly
- [x] Hot module replacement functional

### Monitoring
- [ ] Track WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] Monitor asset loading times
- [ ] Check for 404 errors on resource loads

## Asset URLs
### Working
- [x] Three.js library loading
- [x] Basic texture loading
