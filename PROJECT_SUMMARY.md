1. Project Overview

Bouncing Blitz is a fun, fast-paced browser game where players control a beach ball that navigates through obstacle-ridden tracks composed mainly of rectangles. The ball gains velocity and must bounce between platforms to avoid falling into the abyss. If the ball falls, it gets teleported back and is immobilized for a second. The game features multiple levels, a built-in level editor, and supports multiplayer races through online lobbies.
